this is an app that allows people to 
<br>
1. submit prayer requests
<br>
2. view prayer requests by week
<br>
The idea is a very simple one that came out of the need to view prayer requests on a week by week basis. Traditionally, the small groups I have been in used a google doc. However, this proved to be cumbersome for a few reasons. One, the link was long and required people to go to their email or docs app to open it. Two, it usually relied on one person to act as scribe to gather requests, which made it difficult to do when we split into multiple groups. Three, the doc would get very long and wasn't naturally organized for weekly meetings.<br>
InterSeed is a solution to the above problems. By allowing people to submit requests we no longer rely on a single person to act as scribe and manually enter everything into a google doc. When registering, a person specifies what day the group meets, and InterSeed automatically shows you requests for the current week.<br>
It's a simple organizational tweak that I hope will make things more convenient for many small groups.
